## Anomaly
This project applies an unsupervised machine learning algorithm (Isolation Forest) to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using transaction data from kaggle. The model identifies unusual patterns in transaction behavior; such as anomalies in amount, time, and location, without relying on labeled training data.
